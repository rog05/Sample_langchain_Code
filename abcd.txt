\section{Data Cleaning and Preparation}

The dataset had two parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Load data:} Shows hourly electricity usage for a specific zone
    \item \textbf{Weather data:} Shows hourly temperature from weather stations
\end{itemize}

Steps for clean and prepare the data
\begin{itemize}
    \item Filled missing values
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For load data, I used the median value for each hour.
        \item For weather data, I used forward and backward filling
    \end{itemize}
    \item Removed extreme values using Winsorization to reduce outliers.
    \item Created new time-based features such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hour of the day
        \item Day of the week
        \item Month
        \item Weekend flag (1 for weekend, 0 for weekday)
        \item 24-hour rolling averages for load and temperature
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection*{Hourly Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load increases in the morning (around 7 to 9 AM) and again in the evening (around 6 to 8 PM).
    \item Weekends have lower and more stable electricity usage compared to weekdays.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Seasonal Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load is highest in the summer months, in July and August, most likely due to the use of air conditioning.
    \item Boxplots by month and quarter show clear changes in electricity use across different times of the year.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Temperature and Load}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load increases with temperature, after it goes above 75Â°F.
    \item A line plot of average load by temperature bin shows a strong increase in load during hotter conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other Visuals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Heatmaps show consistent patterns in load by hour and day of the week.
    \item Histograms show the overall distribution of load and temperature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Electricity load follows a daily routine, with morning and evening peaks.
    \item Weekends usually have lower electricity use compared to weekdays.
    \item Higher temperatures lead to increased electricity use.
    \item Electricity usage changes across seasons.
    \item Rolling averages help show patterns and may be useful for future modeling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Optional: Basic Modeling}

I used a Random Forest model to predict electricity load using the features created earlier. This step was optional but helped confirm the patterns found in the data.

Steps I followed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scaled the input features.
    \item Used a time-based split to keep training and testing data in the correct order.
    \item Tuned the model using grid search.
\end{itemize}

Model results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 271.99 MW
    \item Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 377.97 MW
\end{itemize}

Important features for prediction included temperature, hour of day, and 24-hour rolling load average, which matches the findings from the earlier analysis.

\section{Conclusion}

This analysis showed how electricity usage changes throughout the day, during weekends, and across different seasons.
